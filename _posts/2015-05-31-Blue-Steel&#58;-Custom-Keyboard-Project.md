Alright so in the coming weeks, I should recieve all the parts I need (less the keycaps) to get started on building my keyboard. 
It will be a 75% keyboard similar in layout to a [Duck Octagon](http://duck0113.tistory.com/category/75%20Mini), no LEDs, and made of stainless steel. 
Handwired, because I was so fickle minded with the layout that I bought the teensy instead.

I would probably be waiting for the Penumbra Round 2 keycaps from [CTRL]ALT to go with the keyboard as well.
